Investigation into the shape of the inner DM halo with stream
kinematics.

Code based on the paper Bovy, Bahmanyar, Fritz, & Kallivayalil (2016),
which you should cite if you re-use any of this code (in addition to,
most likely, `galpy <https://github.com/jobovy/galpy>`__).
The ipython notebooks used to generate the plots in this paper can be
found in the ``notebooks/`` directory of this repository.
This code uses `galpy <https://github.com/jobovy/galpy>`__.
